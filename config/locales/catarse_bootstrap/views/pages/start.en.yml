We also work with some of the best small business embroidery shops all around the country to ensure you get the best quality. You keep all the profit and we handle all the manufacturing and shipping to your customer. So no overhead ever. Just money!'

          3:
            question: 'Does Boss Brims select campaigns that go online?'
            answer: 'You create your draft and publish your campaign directly through the site. However, there are a few <a href="/rules"> rules to create campaigns </a> that you must follow so that your campaign has no risk of being reported by the community after the publication. As long as the price you sell it is above the base price, everything should be fine.'

            question: 'I need to reach the goal to receive my money?'
            answer: '12 hat minimums are most campaigns. If the campaign does not meet the collection goal, we will fully refund the money to your supporters, at no cost to you or your supporter. <br> <br> In the flexible mode of financing, affectionately called "Flex", you get all the money you can get regardless of hitting the target or not. "Certain hats only"'

            question: 'What are our rates?'
            answer: 'You keep every penny above the base price.'
          3:
            question: 'Where does the money for my campaign comes from?'
            answer: 'Thats up to you. Family, friends, fans and members of communities that you are part of are your greatest contributors. You shake this network, win support and promote the campaign. Supporters advertise and recommend their campaign to others they know, and so the circle of supporters grows and the campaign gets funded. The key is to build a good campaign, plan your campaign well and know how to target your outreach efforts to those who really care about what you are proposing in your crowdfunding campaign.'
